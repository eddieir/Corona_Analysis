This repo is dedicated to analysis and visulization of the statistics of Affected people by coronavirus(COVID-19). 

**Note: this dataset is not the realtime dataset therefore it could show the less number of affected people comapre to the current moment

The data which used for this project is taken from Kaggle dataset and the mentioned data has the csv format and can be download by either clone this repo or use the link which provided by Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset. 

The first phase of this project is data cleaning and deriving the useful.Once this step done with success and get rid of Nan value we could start to visulization and analysis.

In order to have the better presentation of the follwing figure provided:

This virus is famous to spread over time very fast and for showing this fact the following two gifs are provided:
The first gif shows the spread this virus over the globe

As we shown at the above gifs and proof the fast speed for spreading this virus the following two figures are provided which shows the confirmed cases over time over the world:

Once we show the spread of this virus over time and over glob we need to show the number of affected,dead ands recoverved inside the china and over the glob:

And the last figure will show the recovery and mortality rate of this virus:
